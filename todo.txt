The vision here is to recreate the witness protection game in software, then run simulations. I
want to each character to have a variety of attributes, including speed, endurance, suspicions,
trusts, knowledge of what roles are available, ability to blend into the environment, ability to
hide, to seek, to follow, etc.

TODO:
- Make tests work
- Add comments
